SharpDX.Toolkit.Game.Direct2D
=============================

Provides Direct2D and DirectWrite to Toolkit's Game class


This is an (unofficial) preliminary implementation that might eventually get integrated in the next iteration of the Toolkit.

The ```Direct2DService``` class still has some problems when window gets resized, the origin of the problem is explained here: https://github.com/aybe/SharpDX.Toolkit.Game.Direct2D/blob/master/SharpDX.Toolkit.Game.Ex.WinRT/Direct2DService.cs#L133
